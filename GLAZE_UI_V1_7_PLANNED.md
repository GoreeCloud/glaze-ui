# Glaze UI V1.7 Planned Upgrade

## Authority Boundary

This document records the planned direction for **GLAZE UI V1.7**. It is a planning and requirements artifact. It does not by itself establish implementation, qualification, release, deployment, consumer eligibility, or production acceptance.

The current verified Official Anchor authority remains **GLAZE UI V1.6 / 1.6.0**. Stable compatibility fields remain in the lifecycle registry for existing tooling and historical evidence.

As of 2026-09-26, the canonical repository contains bounded V1.7 Development foundations through **1.7.0-dev.16**. Historical implementation references remain bound to the plan revision they were built against: dev.1–dev.7 use the earlier v1.0 numbering, dev.8–dev.13 use the prior v1.1 35-section numbering, dev.14 is the first explicitly v1.2-bound source foundation for **Section 22 — Glaze Signature Motion System**, dev.15 adds the bounded **Section 23 — Signature Motion Principles** source layer, and dev.16 adds the bounded **Section 24 — Glaze Signature Transition Families** semantic choreography layer. dev.16 maps the ten named families—Glaze Bloom, Flow, Lift, Veil, Fold, Trace, Settle, Focus Transfer, Color Shift, and Material Shift—to their governed semantic relationships, choreography channels, Reduced Motion equivalents, Reduced Transparency fallback where applicable, certainty-first critical Veil behavior, and family-specific anti-decoration constraints without accepting raw timing/easing/spring/path controls. dev.14 does **not** establish Section 22 completion, dev.15 does **not** establish Section 23 completion or measured responsiveness acceptance, and dev.16 does **not** establish Section 24 completion, rendered/native choreography acceptance, any later v1.2 motion section, consumer eligibility, Release Candidate, Anchor, deployment, or production acceptance. The separate Glaze Motion 0.6 lifecycle remains Experimental. dev.13's “v1.1 Section 28 Continuity-Aware Motion” remains historical implementation provenance and must **not** be reinterpreted as v1.2 Section 28 Theme Transition System.

All V1.7 Development work remains non-consumer-eligible. Nothing in this document independently changes `VERSION`, `registry/lifecycle.json`, the V1.6 Anchor runtime or release evidence, downstream consumer eligibility, or provider-owned security, privacy, permission, capability, connectivity, recovery, identity, consent, authorization, or availability truth.

### Overview

Glaze UI V1.7 is planned as the next major evolution of the GoreeCloud visual and interaction design system.

V1.7 should build upon the established Glaze foundations for adaptive presentation, semantic state, accessibility, material behavior, dynamic color, personalization, motion, responsive composition, resilience, performance, and conformance.

The release should focus on four major areas:

**Interaction Continuity. Advanced Personalization. Semantic Color Intelligence. Signature Motion.**

The governing V1.7 principle is:

> **The interface may change shape, material, density, color, motion, input mapping, or composition as the environment changes; the user's task, intent, accessibility, identity, and authoritative system truth must remain continuous.**

Glaze UI remains a presentation system. It may visually represent supplied context and state, but it must never manufacture authorization, capability, security, privacy, permission, consent, availability, or other provider-owned truth.

Motion should become one of the recognizable characteristics of GoreeCloud software, but animation must always explain interaction, hierarchy, continuity, state, or identity rather than exist merely as decoration.

## 1. Task Continuity System

V1.7 should introduce a first-class Task Continuity contract governing how interface state survives changes in environment and presentation.

Continuity should preserve appropriate:

- Navigation destination
- Focus
- Selection
- Scroll position
- Expanded state
- Drafts
- Form input
- Filters
- Search queries
- Pane state
- Media state
- Safe pending interactions
These states should survive window resizing, rotation, foldable posture transitions, compact-to-expanded layouts, input changes, accessibility changes, theme changes, appearance changes, connectivity changes, and multi-pane recomposition.

A presentation change must not silently become a task reset.

## 2. Adaptive Input 2.0

Glaze UI V1.7 should define a unified semantic interaction model for:

- Touch
- Pointer
- Keyboard
- Stylus
- Remote/D-pad
- Rotary input
- Switch access
- Voice access
- Assistive input systems
Actions should be defined by intent rather than by a specific gesture.

Drag, swipe, hover, long press, precision-pointer interactions, and multi-touch gestures must have appropriate alternatives when unavailable.

Changing input methods must not change command meaning or unnecessarily disturb the current task.

## 3. First-Class Form-Factor Profiles

V1.7 should formalize reusable composition profiles for:

- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop
- Foldable and posture-aware devices
- TV and far-view environments
- Wearables
Mobile and Tablet should continue to receive first design, implementation, optimization, and validation priority wherever supported.

Each profile should intentionally define navigation, reachability, density, typography, safe areas, viewing distance, action placement, pane behavior, input assumptions, motion behavior, and target sizing.

Wearable support should move toward a complete first-class Glaze UI contract.

Spatial presentation should remain separately governed until sufficient evidence exists.

## 4. Adaptive Composition

V1.7 should make adaptive composition a core Glaze capability.

The same semantic surface may appear as:

- A bottom sheet on Mobile
- A side pane on Tablet
- A secondary pane on Desktop
- A constrained full-screen experience
- A floating surface where appropriate
- A far-view panel on TV
A new GlzAdaptivePane component should provide governed mappings between these forms.

The surface should retain semantic identity during recomposition.

Focus, selection, scroll state, drafts, navigation state, and accessibility relationships should remain continuous.

## 5. Glaze Command Surface

V1.7 should introduce GlzCommandSurface as a shared foundation for:

- Universal Search
- Application search
- Commands
- Actions
- Contextual actions
- Navigation shortcuts
- Keyboard command palettes
- Touch search
- Remote-friendly command selection
Its presentation should adapt to form factor and input while retaining the same conceptual interaction model.

Search scope, source, availability, provenance, and authority must remain explicit.

## 6. Advanced Theme Manager 2.0

V1.7 should introduce a significantly more capable Glaze Theme Manager.

The Theme Manager should support:

- Follow System
- Light
- Dark
- Deep Dark
- GoreeCloud theme presets
- User-created themes
- Accent palettes
- Multi-color palettes
- Primary, secondary, and tertiary color families
- Surface atmosphere
- Material intensity
- Glaze clarity
- Calm, Balanced, and Expressive profiles
- Density profiles
- Governed geometry profiles
- Motion-expression profiles
- Wallpaper-derived palettes
- Application-aware themes
- Per-application overrides where appropriate
- Per-device preferences
- Live previews
- Preview-before-Apply
- Accessibility previews
- Color-vision previews
- Contrast diagnostics
- Theme history
- Undo
- Theme duplication
- Safe import/export
- Versioned theme packages
Users should gain substantial visual freedom without gaining the ability to redefine security, privacy, destructive, warning, critical, or other protected semantic meanings.

## 7. Theme Architecture

Themes should resolve through a governed hierarchy:

Accessibility → Protected Semantic State → Product Identity → User Theme → Contextual Accent → Glaze Default

Accessibility has highest presentation priority.

Semantic truth must override personalization where required.

Product identity remains recognizable.

User themes control permitted expressive presentation.

Contextual color provides bounded environmental influence.

The default Glaze presentation remains the final fallback.

## 8. Semantic Color System 2.0

V1.7 should make color an even stronger information system.

Coordinated semantic families should exist for states such as:

- Information
- Success
- Warning
- Error
- Danger
- Critical
- Destructive
- Privacy
- Security
- Protected
- Restricted
- Trusted
- Unverified
- Online
- Offline
- Connecting
- Synchronizing
- Pending
- Unavailable
- Selected
- Focused
- Active
- Disabled
- Attention
- Recovery
Each family should provide suitable treatments for text, icons, symbols, borders, surfaces, Glaze materials, progress, badges, selection, and prominence levels.

## 9. Semantic Color Prominence

Glaze UI should preserve the hierarchy:

Subtle → Standard → Prominent → Critical

Critical treatment must remain rare and reserved for genuinely consequential situations.

Ordinary events must never be visually escalated merely to attract attention.

## 10. Protected Semantic Colors

User themes must not redefine protected meaning.

For example:

- A red theme must not make ordinary actions look destructive.
- A green theme must not imply that ordinary states are safe or verified.
- A custom theme must not suppress Privacy Shield warnings.
- A theme must not make an unprotected security condition appear protected.
**Personalization may change expression. Personalization must not change truth.**

## 11. Semantic Color Layering

Application identity and semantic state should coexist.

An application's identity should remain recognizable while Error, Warning, Privacy, Security, Sync, or other states are presented around or alongside that identity.

V1.7 should define priority rules for compound states to avoid excessive colored borders, badges, surfaces, and competing visual treatments.

## 12. Intelligent Palette Generation

Theme Manager should generate complete perceptually coordinated color families.

Seeds may come from:

- User-selected colors
- GoreeCloud presets
- Wallpaper summaries
- Approved application identity
- Other locally supplied approved inputs
Palette generation should remain contrast-aware and perceptually coherent.

Accessibility validation must occur after derivation.

Generated theme colors must never replace protected semantic palettes.

## 13. Theme Color Roles

Users should customize understandable presentation roles rather than raw implementation tokens.

Examples include:

- Primary accent
- Secondary accent
- Tertiary accent
- Canvas atmosphere
- Interactive highlight
- Selection treatment
- Decorative tint
- Material atmosphere
- Product-identity integration
- Wallpaper influence
Critical semantic roles remain protected.

## 14. Color-Coded Navigation and Interaction

Color may reinforce:

- Current destination
- Current workspace
- Selection
- Focus
- Editing mode
- Drag state
- Active filters
- Search scope
- Current profile
- Related information groups
Focus and selection must remain distinguishable.

Color must never be the only indication of state.

## 15. Color-Coded System State

Shared GoreeCloud state should receive consistent visual treatment.

Wardveil Security remains authoritative for security.

Privacy Shield remains authoritative for privacy.

Everkeep remains authoritative for backup, preservation, continuity, and recovery.

GoreeCloud Identity remains authoritative for applicable identity and authentication truth.

Glaze UI presents supplied states without manufacturing them.

## 16. Connectivity and Synchronization Color

Glaze should clearly distinguish:

- Online
- Offline
- Connecting
- Limited connectivity
- Synchronized
- Synchronizing
- Pending
- Paused
- Conflict
- Unavailable
- Failed
Network connectivity and service synchronization must not be visually conflated.

## 17. Data Visualization Color

V1.7 should provide theme-compatible categorical palettes for:

- Charts
- Analytics
- Calendars
- Timelines
- Maps
- Dashboards
- Other information visualization
Ordinary data colors must not accidentally resemble protected Warning, Error, Critical, Privacy, or Security roles.

Important differences must remain understandable without color alone.

## 18. Theme Accessibility Engine

Every custom theme should be evaluated for:

- Text contrast
- Focus visibility
- Selection visibility
- Semantic-state separation
- Categorical-color separation
- Glaze readability
- Disabled-state clarity
- Color-vision accessibility
- Grayscale usability
- Forced Colors compatibility
Where safe, Glaze may adjust tone, chroma, foreground selection, or material opacity.

Automatic correction must not alter semantic meaning.

## 19. Theme Safety Mode

Invalid or incompatible themes must fail safely.

Glaze should be able to disable unsafe properties or return to a known-good GoreeCloud theme.

A damaged theme must never prevent users from accessing Theme Manager to repair or reset it.

## 20. Theme Packages

V1.7 may define a declarative Glaze Theme Package.

Theme packages should be:

- Versioned
- Inspectible
- Non-executable
- Bounded
- Portable where appropriate
They must not contain arbitrary executable code, trackers, analytics dependencies, remote runtime resources, or authority to redefine protected semantics.

## 21. Local-First Theme Generation

Theme generation should remain local-first.

Glaze itself should not require wallpaper uploads, screenshots, user content, telemetry, or remote analysis merely to generate themes.

A complete theme experience must remain possible offline.

## 22. Glaze Signature Motion System

V1.7 should introduce a distinct Glaze Signature Motion System.

Motion should become recognizable as part of GoreeCloud's identity in the same way material, color, geometry, and typography are recognizable.

The objective is not simply to animate more elements.

The objective is to create a recognizable motion vocabulary built around:

**Continuity. Depth. Material. Precision. Quiet settling.**

V1.7 should define named, reusable transition families that map to semantic relationships.

Applications should request motion by semantic intent instead of inventing arbitrary animations.

## 23. Signature Motion Principles

Glaze motion should follow these principles:

**Respond immediately.**

Controls acknowledge input without perceptible artificial delay.

**Move with purpose.**

Motion explains what changed or how two states relate.

**Preserve identity.**

The same conceptual object should appear to transform rather than disappear and be recreated whenever appropriate.

**Use depth meaningfully.**

Movement through depth should communicate hierarchy, not merely spectacle.

**Settle quietly.**

Routine Glaze motion should avoid unnecessary bouncing, wobbling, oscillation, or repetitive overshoot.

**Remain interruptible.**

User-controlled transitions must be reversible or interruptible where appropriate.

**Never block state.**

State updates, focus changes, navigation, close actions, and task completion must never depend on an animation finishing.

**Respect accessibility.**

Reduced Motion and other accessibility requirements take precedence over visual expression.

## 24. Glaze Signature Transition Families

V1.7 should introduce a recognizable collection of named motion patterns.

### Glaze Bloom

A compact control expands into its connected larger surface while preserving visual identity.

Examples:

- Search capsule → Search panel
- Mini player → Full player
- Quick control → Detailed control
- Notification → Event detail
- Thumbnail → Detail viewer
Shape, material, content hierarchy, and position transition together where technically appropriate.

Bloom should communicate:

**“This is the same thing, expanded.”**

### Glaze Flow

A pane or group reorganizes fluidly into a new composition.

Examples:

- Mobile stacked layout → Tablet split view
- Compact navigation → Navigation rail
- Tablet pane → Desktop side panel
- Folded layout → Unfolded dual-pane layout
Elements should move toward their new semantic destinations rather than disappearing and reappearing arbitrarily.

Flow should communicate:

**“The workspace changed shape, but your task did not.”**

### Glaze Lift

Transient controls emerge from the surface hierarchy through restrained depth, material clarification, opacity, and movement.

Appropriate uses include:

- Menus
- Popovers
- Contextual controls
- Command surfaces
- Temporary toolbars
- Small system overlays
Lift should feel responsive and spatial without becoming theatrical.

### Glaze Veil

Sheets, dialogs, and system overlays may appear through a coordinated transition between the underlying context, scrim, and foreground material.

Rather than simply fading a modal onto the screen, the interface should establish hierarchy progressively.

Veil should communicate:

**“Your current context remains here, but attention has moved above it.”**

Critical dialogs should remain certainty-first and must not depend on translucent effects.

### Glaze Fold

Used when the physical or logical workspace changes posture or partitioning.

Examples include:

- Foldable device posture changes
- Pane splitting
- Pane merging
- Window docking
- Workspace subdivision
Fold should preserve content identity and spatial relationships.

It must not imitate a literal folding animation merely for decoration.

### Glaze Trace

A subtle continuity cue may connect a source interaction with its resulting destination.

Examples:

- Selected navigation item → destination header
- Selected object → inspector pane
- Search result → opened content
- Command → corresponding control surface
Trace may use restrained position, highlight, material, edge, or emphasis continuity.

It must not become a continuous decorative trail.

### Glaze Settle

After user-driven movement such as dragging, resizing, reordering, or direct manipulation, the interface may use a short governed settling transition.

Settle should feel precise rather than springy.

Routine exaggerated bounce or rubber-band motion should not become part of the Glaze identity.

### Glaze Focus Transfer

When focus moves between clearly related interface regions, the visual focus treatment may transition coherently between them.

This is especially useful for:

- Keyboard navigation
- TV directional navigation
- Command surfaces
- Pane transitions
- Dialog restoration
- Adaptive recomposition
The actual focus state must update independently from the animation.

### Glaze Color Shift

Theme, state, or contextual color changes may transition through coordinated perceptual interpolation rather than abrupt independent token replacement.

Uses may include:

- Light ↔ Dark
- Dark ↔ Deep Dark
- Applying a new user theme
- Accent changes
- Wallpaper atmosphere changes
- Non-critical semantic-state changes
Protected semantic meaning must remain immediately recognizable throughout the transition.

### Glaze Material Shift

A surface may transition between:

- Surface
- Soft Glaze
- Glaze
- Deep Glaze
- Solid fallback
when its semantic role legitimately changes.

Blur, transparency, tint, border, luminosity, and depth should behave as one coordinated transition rather than unrelated effects.

Reduced Transparency should substitute a suitable non-translucent equivalent.

## 25. Connected Transformation 2.0

V1.7 should significantly expand Connected Transformation.

When two states represent the same object or task, the system should preferentially preserve identity through transformation.

Governed relationships may include:

- Search control → Search interface
- Navigation item → Destination
- App icon → Application surface where platform appropriate
- Card → Detail view
- Thumbnail → Viewer
- Quick setting → Expanded setting
- Compact player → Full player
- Folder → Folder contents
- Notification → Related event
- Widget → Expanded experience
- Command result → Resulting interface
- Compact pane → Expanded pane
A connected animation must never invent a relationship that does not actually exist.

When identity is unclear, Glaze should fall back to a standard transition.

## 26. Adaptive Composition Motion

Adaptive layout transitions should become a major visual signature of V1.7.

When layouts recompose, Glaze should preserve spatial understanding.

Elements may:

- Reposition
- Resize
- Change hierarchy
- Move between panes
- Merge
- Separate
- Reorder
- Change material level
without creating unnecessary disappearance/reappearance.

This is particularly important for Mobile ↔ Tablet-like resizing, foldable posture changes, desktop window resizing, and multi-pane workspaces.

## 27. Signature Microinteractions

Common actions should receive small, consistent Glaze microinteractions.

Applicable actions include:

- Toggle
- Select
- Favorite
- Save
- Copy
- Pin
- Expand
- Collapse
- Refresh
- Retry
- Send
- Download
- Upload
- Completion
- Reorder
Microinteractions should typically combine only a small number of properties such as:

- Geometry
- Position
- Material
- Icon transformation
- Color
- Opacity
- Bounded scale
They should be quick, readable, and non-disruptive.

Repeated actions must not produce tiring or distracting animation.

## 28. Theme Transition System

Theme Manager should include polished transitions for theme preview and application.

Applying a theme may coordinate:

- Canvas color
- Surface color
- Accent families
- Material atmosphere
- Icon tint
- Selection color
- Non-semantic decorative color
- Appearance mode
The transition should make the relationship between old and new themes understandable without creating a full-screen spectacle.

Theme previews should be cancellable.

A theme should not be considered applied until its configuration state is actually committed by the responsible system.

## 29. Motion Expression Profiles

V1.7 should connect motion to the existing expression model.

### Calm

- Minimal travel
- Fast settling
- Fewer connected transformations
- Restrained material animation
- Almost no decorative movement
### Balanced

- Standard Glaze transitions
- Connected transformations where helpful
- Moderate material and composition continuity
- Default GoreeCloud motion character
### Expressive

- Richer connected transformations
- More pronounced depth relationships
- More visible adaptive recomposition
- Expanded use of signature Glaze motion where semantically justified
Expressive must not mean constant animation.

Accessibility and performance constraints override the selected expression profile.

## 30. Motion Personalization

Theme Manager may expose a bounded Motion Expression preference.

Users may choose governed modes such as:

- Minimal
- Calm
- Balanced
- Expressive
Users should not normally need raw duration, easing, spring, or physics controls.

Theme packages may request approved motion profiles but must not include executable animation code.

## 31. Reduced Motion Equivalents

Every signature transition must define a Reduced Motion equivalent.

Examples:

- Bloom → opacity/shape-state replacement
- Flow → immediate recomposition with brief emphasis
- Lift → opacity change without travel
- Veil → immediate hierarchy change with restrained fade
- Fold → immediate layout replacement
- Trace → static destination highlight
- Settle → immediate final position
- Focus Transfer → immediate focus-ring update
- Color Shift → shortened or immediate palette replacement
- Material Shift → immediate material replacement
Reduced Motion must preserve:

- State
- Meaning
- Focus
- Navigation
- Task continuity
- Direct-manipulation tracking
No critical interaction should require observing motion.

## 32. Motion Fatigue Protection

V1.7 should preserve and strengthen motion budgeting.

The system should limit excessive simultaneous:

- Transitions
- Skeleton animations
- Material animations
- Decorative movements
- Large-area transformations
- Continuous animated elements
When the motion budget is exceeded, optional animation should be reduced automatically.

Semantic state must not be reduced.

## 33. Motion Performance

Signature animation must be designed around predictable rendering performance.

Implementations should prefer compositor-friendly techniques where appropriate.

Glaze should gracefully reduce optional motion under:

- Runtime pressure
- Power-saving conditions
- Thermal constraints
- Low-end hardware
- Low refresh conditions
- Reduced Motion
- Performance-degraded environments
A visually elaborate transition that produces poor responsiveness should fail toward a simpler Glaze transition.

## 34. Glaze Motion Lifecycle

The repository already preserves Glaze Motion as a separately governed experimental foundation.

V1.7 should evaluate whether a bounded subset of that work is ready to become part of the official Glaze UI contract.

Promotion should require independent validation of:

- Accessibility
- Native-platform behavior
- Frame pacing
- Interaction latency
- Interruption
- Reversal
- Reduced Motion
- Physical-device behavior
- Energy impact
- Human motion review
Experimental motion must not become Stable merely because it is visually attractive.

## 35. System Shell Continuity

V1.7 should strengthen System Shell continuity across:

- Notification/activity presentation
- Control Center
- Multi-window
- Split view
- Compact/expanded navigation
- Window restoration
- Application/system handoff
- Task switching
- Universal Search
- Contextual commands
Signature motion should reinforce shell relationships without making shell navigation slower.

## 36. Notification and Activity Surfaces

V1.7 should standardize components such as:

- GlzNotificationSurface
- GlzActivityItem
- GlzActivityGroup
- GlzStatusFeed
- GlzBackgroundTask
- GlzProgressSurface
Motion may reinforce meaningful transitions such as progress, completion, recovery, arrival, expansion, or dismissal.

Persistent pulsing should not become the default way to communicate attention.

## 37. Native Glaze Kits

V1.7 should provide stronger native mappings for applicable:

- Android / Jetpack Compose
- Apple / SwiftUI
- Web
- Linux native environments
Native implementations should preserve Glaze semantic motion while respecting platform interaction behavior, accessibility, rendering architecture, and performance.

The goal is shared motion character, not identical animation implementation.

## 38. Expanded Component System

Potential additions include:

- GlzAdaptivePane
- GlzCommandSurface
- GlzActivitySurface
- GlzNotificationSurface
- GlzAdaptiveToolbar
- GlzActionCluster
- GlzRecoverySurface
- GlzProgressSurface
- GlzPreferenceGroup
- GlzAppearancePicker
- GlzThemePreview
- GlzColorRolePicker
- GlzPalettePreview
- GlzAdaptiveSplitView
Components should expose semantic transition relationships where appropriate instead of embedding arbitrary local animations.

## 39. Glaze Inspector

Glaze Inspector should expose:

- Current motion family
- Transition source and destination
- Connected-identity relationship
- Duration family
- Easing family
- Motion magnitude
- Motion budget
- Reduced Motion mapping
- Theme resolution
- Semantic color resolution
- Material resolution
- Focus state
- Accessibility overrides
Developers should be able to understand why a given animation was selected.

## 40. Glaze Studio

Glaze Studio should provide interactive preview and development tools for:

- Signature transitions
- Motion profiles
- Components
- Adaptive layout changes
- Form-factor transitions
- Themes
- Color palettes
- Accessibility modes
- Reduced Motion
- Input models
- Semantic states
Designers should be able to compare Calm, Balanced, Expressive, and Reduced Motion behavior side by side.

## 41. Accessibility Continuity

Accessibility remains part of continuity.

Changes involving:

- Large text
- Reduced Motion
- Reduced Transparency
- Increased Contrast
- Forced Colors
- Screen readers
- Switch access
- Voice access
- Touch Assistance
- Keyboard navigation
must preserve the current task wherever technically possible.

Accessibility always outranks motion richness.

## 42. Cross-Device Consistency Without Uniformity

Glaze UI should retain common:

- Semantic vocabulary
- Color roles
- State vocabulary
- Motion language
- Material hierarchy
- Interaction principles
- Accessibility expectations
- Authority boundaries
while mapping appropriately to each platform.

A Glaze Bloom on Android, Web, Linux, or another platform does not have to use identical implementation details to communicate the same relationship.

## 43. Visual and Motion Direction

V1.7 should not become “more glass everywhere” or “animation everywhere.”

Its advancement should come from:

- Better adaptive composition
- Stronger theme architecture
- More meaningful semantic color
- Distinctive connected transitions
- Better spatial continuity
- Refined microinteractions
- Native platform adaptation
- Quiet but recognizable GoreeCloud motion
Animation should increase comprehension before it increases spectacle.

## 44. Privacy and Authority Boundaries

Motion and adaptive presentation must not imply state that does not exist.

For example:

- A protection animation must not imply Wardveil protection without authoritative state.
- A synchronization completion animation must not play unless the responsible provider reports completion.
- A success transition must not manufacture success.
- A privacy transition must not imply that access was revoked unless Privacy Shield or the responsible provider confirms it.
Motion communicates truth.

Motion does not create truth.

## 45. Performance and Energy Awareness

Advanced themes, materials, animations, and adaptive transitions must remain performance-conscious.

Optional visual complexity should degrade gracefully under constrained conditions.

Task continuity, accessibility, responsiveness, and semantic state always outrank animation fidelity.

## 46. V1.7 Acceptance

V1.7 qualification should cover:

- Task continuity
- Adaptive composition
- Semantic color
- Theme safety
- Custom-theme accessibility
- Signature motion
- Connected transformations
- Animation interruption
- Animation reversal
- Reduced Motion
- Frame pacing
- Input latency
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop
- Foldable
- TV
- Wearable where claimed
- Keyboard
- Pointer
- Touch
- Alternative input
- Reduced Transparency
- Increased Contrast
- Forced Colors
- Large text
- RTL
- Representative rendering
- Native behavior
- Performance
- Energy behavior where applicable
- Regression
- Human visual and motion review
- Assistive technology
- Privacy boundaries
- Security boundaries
- Artifact provenance
Automated tests alone must not establish complete motion acceptance.

## 47. Proposed V1.7 Identity

**Product:** GLAZE UI
**Version:** V1.7
**Planned theme:** Interaction Continuity + Personal Expression + Signature Motion
**Lifecycle:** Planned
**Consumer eligibility:** No until separately implemented, qualified, and promoted
**Primary objective:** Preserve user task and authoritative meaning while allowing Glaze UI to adapt deeply across themes, color, movement, form factors, input systems, accessibility configurations, platforms, and presentation environments.
## Final Direction

Glaze UI V1.7 should move GoreeCloud beyond a shared visual design language.

It should become a complete adaptive presentation language in which:

**Color communicates meaning.**

**Material communicates hierarchy.**

**Motion communicates relationship.**

**Composition communicates structure.**

**Themes communicate personal expression.**

**Accessibility governs how all of them resolve.**

A GoreeCloud interface should be capable of moving from phone to tablet, folded to unfolded, touch to keyboard, Light to Deep Dark, default theme to a custom theme, compact control to expanded workspace, or ordinary presentation to an accessibility configuration without making the user lose track of where they are or what they were doing.

Glaze UI should have transitions that users can recognize as distinctly GoreeCloud—not because they are excessive, but because they are coherent.

The defining qualities of Glaze UI V1.7 should therefore be:

**Continuous. Adaptive. Expressive. Fluid. Accessible. Semantic. Native. Truthful.**

.
